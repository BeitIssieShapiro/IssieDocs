# IssieDocs - Project Overview

## Description
**IssieDocs** is a React Native mobile application (iOS/Android) that enables users to work on printed documents or worksheets by capturing them with a camera and adding annotations through typing, drawing, and audio.

- Organize documents in customizable folders
- Share and export documents as images or PDFs
- Backup and restore entire document collections
