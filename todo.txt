Bugs:
V- when closing keyboard, move back
V- when in zoom and open keyboard, sometimes loose location - move not considering zoom - 
V- camera not in right orientation sometimes 

V - when you crop in 2 pages - save - first page's crop is lost and second is zoomed?
V - in landscape mode, the color selection's circles are growing and are cut
V - when typing:
    V - long text, do not let the text go over the page - wrap it
    V - while typing if the text goes below the keyboard - move page
V - when editing large font size, when exiting text mode the size changes (or is it just the yellow?)
